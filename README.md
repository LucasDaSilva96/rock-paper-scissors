# rock-paper-scissors

## The Pseudo Code

- Created an array with the values: 'rock', 'paper', 'scissor'.

- Create a function that returns either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissor'.

- Create a function that prompt's the user to choose between rock, paper and scissors, and return that value + save the value in a global variable.

- Create two global variables that stores the amount of point that the computer/player has.

- Create a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and the ComputerSelection, and then return a single string that declares the winner of the round. (This function should be case-insensitive) AND updates the amount of points that the WINNER has by 1.

- Create the game function. The function should keep track of rounds, update the winner's-score.
