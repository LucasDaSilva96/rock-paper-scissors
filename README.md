## Live-code: https://lucasdasilva96.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

## The Pseudo Code

- Created an array with the values: 'rock', 'paper', 'scissor'.

- Create a function that returns either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissor'.

- Create two global variables that stores the amount of point that the computer/player has.

- Create a function that gets the user's choice and save it on a global variable

- Create a function that plays the game of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and the ComputerSelection, and then return the winner of the round. (This function should be case-insensitive) AND updates the amount of points that the WINNER has by 1.

- Create a function that keeps track of the points. The function should update the winner's-score after each round and in the end announce the winner.
